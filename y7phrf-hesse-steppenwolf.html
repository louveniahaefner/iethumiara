It's been awhile since I have read the book, but in the English translated version I read, Hermine says: "Nobody wants to avoid the next war, nobody wants to spare himself and his children the next holocaust if this be the cost."

Hi /r/books - as the title states, I just got done reading Hesse's Steppenwolf  I'll say from the get-go that a lot of it went over my head, and at times I certainly struggled with the verbosity of the writing. I had a lot of trouble relating to Harry Haller, the protagonist of the story.

All right, I just finished re-reading Hermann Hesse's Steppenwolf  Last time I read it was in the 80s, so you do the math. I misremembered the book being a bit emo and daft, but after re-reading it, it's clear that it was I who was emo and daft when I first read it. Anyway, I will say that I found the book quite engrossing. The 'wolf still packs a punch, almost a century after it was first published.

I am currently in the process of carrying out research for my literary dissertation. Primarily, I am interested in what role women have in the urban environment, and the concept of the "flâneur". I want to question whether or not a female equivalent, a "flâneuse", can truly exist, and if so does this equivalent have to be reinvented (or is it possible for a women to adopt the "masculine traits" of a flâneur")? My original choice of texts for exploring this subject were -Hermann Hesse's Steppen. If a work of art could commit a sin, it would be that of leaving those who encounter it indifferent.

It started with reading 2 books and switching between them as I went, because sometimes it just felt good to have a different story to follow for a time before returning to the first. Now it's become 8 books that I cycle through in a month or two. Never reading one all the way through without reading others as well. Is this counterintuitive? Am I not getting absorbed

Hi /r/ writing. I'm interested in your opinion of an idea I've been working on for quite some time. After writing dozens of stories with which I'm not satisfied anymore after so much time has passed since writing them ( I consider them bad/pathetic ). I've realized I want to work on something far greater, especially because I'm 23 y/o now and I haven't done much in life ( I don't consider graduating college and continuing with my studies a success, but more of a neccessity to survive ).

I've been on a bit of a kick lately where I really enjoy and get a lot of catharsis from books like Herman Hesse's Steppenwolf and Osamu Dazai's No Longer Human, and while not a book, the Manga Oyasumi Punpun is also similar to what I'm looking for. I'd like to read more books like these. I tried reading more of Dazai's work, and while interesting they didn't really give me that gnawing introspection and despair I'm seeking. Steppenwolf tells the story of alienated intellectual Harry Haller and his mid-life crisis. Actually, to say that this book tells a story is a bit misleading. The Bible or Quran or Torah won't do it.
